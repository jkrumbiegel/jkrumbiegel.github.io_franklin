This post goes over some questions I had for the dataset, and how I approached the analysis with my recent macro package DataFrameMacros.jl. Plotting is done with AlgebraOfGraphics.jl, which is a super useful grammar-of-graphics style package building on Makie.jl, which I&#39;m a co-author of and which is therefore my preferred plotting package.</p> <p>Let&#39;s set up some basics and import the necessary packages:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> CairoMakie

set_theme!(theme_minimal(), font = <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Avenir Light&quot;</span>)</code></pre> <p>First, we need to download the dataset, which is available on <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martj42/international_results/master/results.csv">github</a>.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">url = <span class=hljs-string >&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martj42/international_results/master/results.csv&quot;</span>

In DataFrameMacros.jl, you can group by columns that you create directly in the groupby call.</p> <p>We can directly visualize the result by chaining the analysis into AlgebraOfGraphics.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>
    <span class=hljs-meta >@groupby</span>(:year = year(:date))
    combine(nrow =&gt; :n_games)
    data(_) *
        mapping(:year =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Year&quot;</span>, :n_games =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Number of games&quot;</span>) *
        visual(Scatter)
    draw
<span class=hljs-keyword >end</span></code></pre> <p><img src="/assets/2021-06-20-football-data-analysis/208765501.svg" alt="" /></p> <p>There has been a huge growth in the number of games per year. What could have been the driving factors there? We could look at the development of friendly vs. non-friendly games.</p> <p>As soon as there are some groups to plot separately, I like using AlgebraOfGraphics.jl, which does all the work of grouping and legend building for me. I can build one long chain that culminates in a plot, so I don&#39;t have to come up with names for intermediary steps.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>
    <span class=hljs-meta >@groupby</span>(:year = year(:date), :friendly = :tournament == <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Friendly&quot;</span>)
    combine(nrow =&gt; :n_games)
    data(_) *
        mapping(:year =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Year&quot;</span>, :n_games =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Number of games&quot;</span>,

<span class=hljs-keyword >end</span></code></pre> <p><img src="/assets/2021-06-20-football-data-analysis/1108091503.svg" alt="" /></p> <p>So we can see that both friendlies and competitions have become much more numerous, although the competitions are responsible for the larger share.</p> <p>Another way we could look at this information is to count the number of different competitions per year:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>
    <span class=hljs-meta >@subset</span>(:tournament != <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Friendly&quot;</span>)

        mapping(:year =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Year&quot;</span>, :n_competitions =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Number of competitions&quot;</span>) *
        (visual(Scatter, markersize = <span class=hljs-number >5</span>) + smooth())
    draw
<span class=hljs-keyword >end</span></code></pre> <p><img src="/assets/2021-06-20-football-data-analysis/1871856845.svg" alt="" /></p> <p>And of course the average number of teams per competition:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>
    <span class=hljs-meta >@subset</span>(:tournament != <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Friendly&quot;</span>)
    <span class=hljs-meta >@groupby</span>(:year = year(:date), :tournament)
    <span class=hljs-meta >@combine</span>(:n_teams = <span class=hljs-meta >@c</span> length(unique(vcat(:home_team, :away_team))))
    data(_) *
        mapping(:year =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Year&quot;</span>, :n_teams =&gt; <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Number of teams per competition&quot;</span>) *
        (visual(Scatter, markersize = <span class=hljs-number >4</span>, color = (:black, <span class=hljs-number >0.3</span>)) + smooth() * visual(linewidth = <span class=hljs-number >3</span>))

As football has become more and more professionalized, do the highly trained players of today score more or fewer goals? &#40;The defense is also better trained, of course.&#41;</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>

This dataset can give no indication, though, what the reasons for this development might be.</p> <p>One thing we can look at, though, is the distribution of goal differences over time. Maybe the teams were just much more different in ability before?</p> <p>We could make histograms for 1954 and 1990, which had high and low averages, respectively.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>
    <span class=hljs-meta >@transform</span>(:year = year(:date))

For a quick glance, we can compute the probability of winning as the home team.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>

This could be a bit misleading, potentially, if the better teams are also somehow the teams that host more games.</p> <p>So we could check how it looks if we compute the win lose ratio for each team separately. One problem is that each &quot;team&quot; &#40;country&#41; changes all the time, and Germany from 1950 has nothing in common with Germany from 2020. As an approximation, we can split the timeline into 5 year bins, and calculate the ratio within those.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >@chain</span> df <span class=hljs-keyword >begin</span>
